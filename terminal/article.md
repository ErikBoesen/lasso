Good afternoon, Principal Hills!

I'm writing today to give my opinion on, and ask for a revision of, the GMHS policy of blocking the app Terminal on student and faculty MacBooks.

Terminal is an app used to interface with a computer through the "command line." The application, which is included by default with new Macs, is imperative for efficiently writing and running code in any programming language. This application is essential to nearly everything we do in extracurricular programs such as the robotics team and CyberPatriot, and for personal projects related to programming outside of those groups.

Terminal sometimes has a bad reputation in the mind of the public. This is understandable given that many people might only come into contact with the software while watching movies involving "hackers." But in reality, this reputation for malicious use is totally inaccurate. Every programmer needs and uses terminal access, and the colossal majority of activity using the app—both in education and in the world as a whole—is totally benign. The terminal simply allows for a more efficient and technical method of interacting with a computer, and has no intrinsic link to any sort of dangerous activity. Furthermore, any malicious activity for which one could use terminal could conceivably be executed without it. By extension, anyone capable of using terminal to engage in malicious activity would also likely be capable of circumventing the blockage of the application.

As I've already mentioned, we need terminal in CyberPatriot for competing and for writing scripts to automate parts of the competition and gain points more quickly. In robotics, we need terminal to write robot code, deploy code to the robot, write and publish code for our driving dashboards, update our website, etc. Without access to the tool our teams simply cannot function.

And to be clear, it's not only for specific extracurricular activities that students need access to terminal. I and other students need it for literally every IB HL Computer Science class period, and we need it to work on personal projects for the advancement of our own education. I need terminal to continue learning about computers and programming, as do many other students. In addition, students interested in learning about how to program may be significantly discouraged by an inability to use one of the crucial tools needed for that activity and are far less likely to continue working on developing this increasingly important skill.

As it currently stands, the MacBook security system GM uses blocks the applications Terminal, term, iTerm, iTerm2, RetroTerm, MacTerm, Terminator, TotalTerminal, xterm, Docker Quickstart Terminal, DTerm, and tmux. Most of these are alternative terminal applications with extra features and capabilities. The final item, tmux, is not actually an application in itself, rather a totally harmless yet useful programming tool which I cannot imagine being used for any malicious purpose.

I understand that our IT department most likely blocked these applications with good intentions out of concern that students might use them to violate other rules, but I believe that outright blocking this incredibly important tool is the wrong way to go about securing the school's network and computers. Sure, it might save a bit of time, but any student dedicated to engaging in malicious behavior is best stopped by monitoring and good security practice rather than by taking away the tools which many other well-behaved students, such as myself, need to pursue our education.

The idea of allowing the application for use only by certain students, such as robotics programmers, has been floated, however I view this plan as severely misguided. Not all students who need access to terminal and similar tools are on robotics, and maintaining a list of all computers authorized to use certain applications would be a hugely inconvenient task for our IT department.

To resolve this situation, I'd like to humbly propose that extant blockage of the aforementioned terminal applications be promptly terminated. Allowing use of these applications would be a trivial change: they'd simply need to be removed from the security blacklist and the changes would propagate automatically to all students, with no reimaging or logistical headache necessary.

Please let me know if you'd like me to speak further with yourself or other faculty of give any further commentary related to this issue. I hope that we can resolve this issue promptly to aid GMHS' technically involved students.

Thank you so much for your attention and correspondence,
Erik Boesen
